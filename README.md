- My name is M. Hossein Jabbarzadeh (You can call me Jab). ðŸ‘€
- I am a back-end developer and a computer engineering student. 
- I mostly work with Django and FastAPI as the main back-end framework. I also code in go.
- Although I am not much of front-end guy, I use Apline.js, HTMX, and Bootstrap to beautify the front-ends.
- Postgres and Mongodb are my first choice as database. I use redis, too. I have worked with neo4j, too.
- You can reach me by my email which is heythisisjab [at] gmail.com.
- Also, I have a [linkedin profile](https://linkedin.com/in/thisisjab/) which you may be interested to check out.
